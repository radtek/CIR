LLBLGen Pro v2.5 Reference manual for .NET 2.0
================================================
The .NET 2.0 runtime libraries reference manual is for VS.NET 2005 / MSDN help v2 system. To
be able to read the help, please run registerhelp2.bat. This should install the help in the VS.NET 
2005 help index/contents tree. To remove the reference manual help, run unregisterhelp2.bat.

Please run the registerhelp2.bat from a command prompt, as running it from Explorer will not successfully
register the reference manual as the working folder will be incorrectly set by Explorer. 

If you're on Windows Vista, please start the command prompt as Administrator. 

If VS.NET 2005 is running, please close VS.NET 2005 and restart VS.NET 2005 after registering to make the
reference manual show up. 

We also offer a .CHM version of the reference manual on our website for your convenience if you decide
not to register the reference manual with VS.NET.
