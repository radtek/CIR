========================================================
Released on: 01-jul-2006
Version: 2.0


INSTALLATION
=============
Unpack the archive in a new folder and start VS.NET 2005. Go to Tools -> Code Snippets Manager, click
'Add' and browse to the folder you've unpacked this archive in and click OK. The snippets are now
available.


USAGE
=====
There are snippets for Adapter and Selfservicing and all snippets are available in both C# and VB.NET
Each snippet has a shortcut, starting with 'llbl' and 'A' for adapter and 'S' for selfservicing. 
Example: 'llblA_FetchAllEntities'.

Some snippets are short, others are more verbose to help you get started. As they're plain XML, you can
adjust them to your liking. The snippet archive is updated regularly with new snippets.
